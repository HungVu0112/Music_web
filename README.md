# Music Website 
 
1.1 Context 
In today's society, as the Internet gradually extends its reach globally, humans are becoming increasingly globalized. Simultaneously, with this development, the demand for entertainment services, stress relief, and more has grown rapidly. The main reason for this is that in a world that is becoming increasingly "flat," we find ourselves facing more pressures and stress in life from family, friends, and society. Therefore, we aim to create a music website to satisfy the relaxation needs of users.
